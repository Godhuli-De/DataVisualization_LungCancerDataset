# DataVisualization_LungCancerDataset

This project involves the exploration and visualization of a lung cancer dataset to uncover insights and patterns. The dataset includes various attributes related to lung cancer symptoms, patient habits, and medical conditions. The aim is to use data visualization techniques to understand the relationships and distributions of these attributes and their impact on lung cancer.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is survey lung cancer.csv.

Using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn to perform EDA on Lung Cancer Dataset

**Data Visualization and EDA**
- Distribution Plots: Visualized the distribution of numerical features.
- Count Plots: Displayed the count of categories in categorical features.
- Box Plots: Compared distributions of numerical features across categories.
- Heatmaps: Showed correlations between numerical features.
- Pair Plots: Visualized pairwise relationships between selected features.
- Joint Plots: Examined relationships between pairs of features.
- Feature Importances: Identified important features using a RandomForestClassifier.
